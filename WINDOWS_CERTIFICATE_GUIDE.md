### Common Issues:

#### "Access Denied" when running batch file

- **Solution:** Make sure you installed to **"Trusted Root Certification Authorities"**, not "Personal"

#### Browser still shows warnings
- **Solution:** Complete browser restart is required (close all windows, wait, reopen)

#### PowerShell execution error
- **Solution:** Run PowerShell as Administrator and enable script execution:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

## 🧪 Verification Steps

After installation, verify the certificate is working:

1. **Test with curl:**

   ```
   Should return HTTP/2 200 without certificate errors

2. **Test in browser:**
   - Visit `https://localhost:8000`
   - Check for green lock icon in address bar
   - No "Not Secure" warnings should appear

3. **Run automated test:**
   ```bash
   python test_certificate_install.py
   ```
